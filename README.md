Advanced Analytics For Strategy Tester

I created this project due to a real problem I saw among traders. MetaTrader5 is an extremely popular and commonly used platform among traders that provides accurate back testing and some analytics, but what most traders fail to realize is that passing a back test simply is not sufficient enough to verify a valid strategy. What many fail to realize is that often strategies are over fitted or pass a backtest by pure luck. Institutions and hedge funds know this and perform a number of other tests to determine a viable strategy. I aim to help provide SOME of these institutional level tests for free. This is where [analyticclarity.com](https://analyticclarity.com/) comes in. 
Note: This could also work for custom python stratergy setups provided your documented trades match the same format as mt5.

I have also learnt full stack web development and deployment though this personal project.
